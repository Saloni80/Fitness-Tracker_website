    <p class="one">Calories are units of energy that our body needs to perform essential functions like breathing, digestion, and physical activity. They come from the food we eat, mainly from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein provides 4 calories, while fats provide 9 calories. Consuming the right amount of calories helps maintain a healthy weight, while too many or too few can lead to weight gain or loss. Daily calorie needs vary based on age, gender, activity level, and health status. To stay healthy, itâ€™s important to get calories from nutritious foods rather than sugary or processed ones.</p>
